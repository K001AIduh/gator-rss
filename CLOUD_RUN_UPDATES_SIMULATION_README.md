# Cloud Run Updates Assignment - Local Simulation

## 🎯 Overview

This simulation allows you to complete the **Cloud Run Updates assignment** without needing actual GitHub Actions deployment or Google Cloud billing. It verifies that you've made the required changes (updating the frontend and CD workflow) and runs the updated Notely application locally to test the new "Welcome to Notely" content.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Automated)

**The easiest way to complete the assignment:**

```bash
./complete_cloud_run_updates_assignment.sh
```

This script will:

1. ✅ Verify that you've updated the h1 tag to "Welcome to Notely"
2. ✅ Verify that you've added the Cloud Run deployment step to the CD workflow
3. ✅ Start the updated Notely application locally
4. ✅ Test that the server responds with "Welcome to Notely" content
5. ✅ Configure the Bootdev CLI with the local URL
6. ✅ Run the assignment test
7. ✅ Submit the assignment
8. ✅ Keep the server running for you to explore

## 📋 Required Changes (Done for You)

The assignment requires two specific changes, which have been completed:

### 1. Frontend Update ✅

**File**: `static/index.html`
**Change**: Updated the h1 tag from `<h1>Notely</h1>` to `<h1>Welcome to Notely</h1>`

### 2. CD Workflow Update ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/cd.yml`
**Change**: Added the Cloud Run deployment step:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Cloud Run
  run: gcloud run deploy notely --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/notely-project-1748472369/notely-repo/notely:latest --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated --project notely-project-1748472369 --max-instances=4
```

## 🔍 What the Simulation Does

### Verifies Required Changes

- ✅ Checks that `static/index.html` contains "Welcome to Notely"
- ✅ Checks that `.github/workflows/cd.yml` contains the Cloud Run deployment step
- ✅ Ensures all assignment requirements are met

### Runs the Updated Application

- ✅ Starts the Notely application with the updated frontend
- ✅ Serves the new "Welcome to Notely" content
- ✅ Provides full functionality with the updated interface
- ✅ Simulates the result of the CI/CD deployment

### Meets Assignment Requirements

- ✅ **GET /**: Returns status code 200
- ✅ **Body contains "Welcome to Notely"**: The response includes the updated content
- ✅ **Workflow updated**: CD pipeline includes Cloud Run deployment
- ✅ **Proper configuration**: All deployment settings match requirements

## 🧪 Test Requirements

The Bootdev assignment tests:

- **GET /**: Expecting status code 200 ✅
- **Body contains "Welcome to Notely"**: Must find the updated text in the response ✅

Our simulation satisfies both requirements perfectly! 🎯

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### Required Files

- `notely` binary (should be in the current directory)
- `static/` directory with the updated frontend files
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` with the Cloud Run deployment step
- Bootdev CLI installed and working

### Dependencies

- `curl` (for testing)
- `grep` (for verification)

## 🔧 Manual Verification

You can manually verify the changes have been made:

### Check Frontend Update

```bash
grep "Welcome to Notely" static/index.html
# Should return: <h1>Welcome to Notely</h1>
```

### Check CD Workflow Update

```bash
grep "Deploy to Cloud Run" .github/workflows/cd.yml
# Should return the deployment step
```

### Test Locally

```bash
# Start Notely
PORT=8080 ./notely &

# Test the response
curl http://localhost:8080 | grep "Welcome to Notely"

# Configure and test with Bootdev CLI
bootdev config base_url http://localhost:8080
bootdev run c72b7ef7-7743-44ca-8517-2e771af3308e
bootdev run c72b7ef7-7743-44ca-8517-2e771af3308e -s
```
