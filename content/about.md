# About This Static Site Generator

This static site generator was built as a learning project to understand how static site generators work.

1. **Content Creation**: Write content in Markdown format
2. **Template Application**: Apply HTML templates to your content
3. **Static Site Generation**: Convert Markdown to HTML and copy static assets
4. **Deployment**: Host your static site on any web hosting service

## Technologies Used
